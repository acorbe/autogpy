### Which problem does it solve?

`autogpy` eliminates annoying duplications of code/data when doing data analytics in python and publication figures in gnuplot. Using a syntax close to gnuplot, it automatically generates gnuplot scripts and dumps suitably the data.  

In the scientific community, [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is a gold standard for publication-quality plots. While python comes with several options for plotting, often gnuplot is preferred in production.


### Features
+ anything that be obtained by the gnuplot command `plot` can be produced
+ any gnuplot state modification can be achieved
+ multiplots
+ `plt.hist`-like gnuplot histogram figures generator
+ jupyter notebook figure preview
+ jupyter notebook gnuplot script inspection
+ gnuplot terminals epslatex, tikz/pgfplot and jpg
+ output figures are shipped in a folder that includes scripts, data and makefile
+ easy scp-based synchronization between a machine in which the figures are generated (e.g. from even larger datasets) and the "paper writing" machine.

**Works on**
+ Linux/MacOs
+ Python 3

**KWONW ISSUES**
+ Certain features require imagemagick and a working `gnuplot-tikz.lua`. Some versions of these might have bugs. Do `figure.display_fixes()` to show known fixes.



## In a nutshell

### Getting autogpy

From `pip`

```bash
pip install autogpy

```

From source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:acorbe/autogpy.git
pip install autogpy/
```

### Usage 

Please see also the [examples](https://github.com/acorbe/autogpy/tree/master/examples) and the [documentation](https://acorbe.github.io/autogpy/).

```python
import autogpy
import numpy as np

xx = np.linspace(0,6,100)
yy = np.sin(xx)
zz = np.cos(xx)

with autogpy.AutogpyFigure("test_figure") as figure: 

	# gnuplot syntax case
	figure.plot(r'with lines t "sin"',xx,yy)
	
	# python style
	figure.plot(xx,zz, u = '1:2', w='lines', label = 'cos')

```

will generate the following figure (also appearing in jupyter)

**Most importantly**, the following source and data will be created in the folder `test_figure` 

```bash
$ ls test_figure

.gitignore
Makefile
sync_me.sh
fig__0__.dat
fig__1__.dat
fig__.core.gnu
fig__.jpg.gnu
fig__.pdflatex_compile.sh
fig__.pdflatex.gnu
fig__.tikz_compile.sh
fig__.tikz.gnu
```

With `make` one can obtain jpg, epslatex, and tikz/pgfplot versions of the figure.
Notice that the input data has been formatted automatically.

Inspecting `fig__.pdflatex.gnu`, responsible of the epslatex version of the figure, one gets:
```gnuplot
set terminal epslatex size 9.9cm,8.cm color colortext standalone      'phv,12 '  linewidth 2
set output 'fig.latex.nice/plot_out.tex'

load "fig__.core.gnu"; 
```
while `fig__.core.gnu` reads:
```gnuplot
p "fig__0__.dat" with lines t "sin",\
"fig__1__.dat" u 1:2 with lines t "cos"

```
